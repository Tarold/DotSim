2. Animation: The simulation provides real-time animation, with dots smoothly moving, division, eating.
3. Dot Interactions: Dots can interact with each other based on predefined rules, such as reservation food or hungry rush (will eat even non-grown food).
4. User Controls: Users can spawn food and dots, or input mechanisms to modify simulation settings.
